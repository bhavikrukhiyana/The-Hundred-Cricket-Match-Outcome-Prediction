# The Hundred Cricket Match Outcome Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting match outcomes in The Hundred cricket league.

## Project Overview

The Hundred is a novel cricket format introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes based on player performance metrics and team statistics.

## Key Features

- Data collection and preprocessing of ball-by-ball data from 187 matches
- Feature engineering incorporating both player-level and team-level statistics
- Implementation of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models
- Gender-specific analysis of prediction performance
- Evaluation of model generalization to future season data

## Data

The data used in this project was sourced from cricsheet.org, covering matches from the 2021-2023 seasons of The Hundred.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Development (Random Forest and SVM)
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Performance Evaluation
6. Gender-based Analysis

## Results

- High accuracy on the test set for both models
- Significant disparity in performance between men's and women's matches
- Identification of key features influencing match outcomes

## Future Work

- Mitigation of overfitting in the Random Forest model
- Incorporation of additional contextual factors (e.g., weather, pitch conditions)
- Development of in-game prediction capabilities
- Exploration of deep learning approaches

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
